# Mistral-and-gTTS-to-Create-Personal-Storyteller
In this project, we'll use Mistral, a large language model, to generate creative stories based on any topic you provide, and then convert these stories into natural-sounding speech.
This project demonstrates how to create an AI storyteller by:

Using Mistral to generate creative and informative stories based on your chosen topic
Converting the generated story into speech using gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)
Playing the audio directly in your Jupyter notebook
