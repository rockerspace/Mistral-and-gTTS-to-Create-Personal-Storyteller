# Mistral-and-gTTS-to-Create-Personal-Storyteller
In this project, we'll use Mistral, a large language model, to generate creative stories based on any topic you provide, and then convert these stories into natural-sounding speech.
This project demonstrates how to create an AI storyteller by:

Using Mistral to generate creative and informative stories based on your chosen topic
Converting the generated story into speech using gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)
Playing the audio directly in your Jupyter notebook

Introduction
Have you ever wanted to create engaging stories and have them read aloud naturally? By combining the power of AI story generation with text-to-speech technology, we can create an interactive storytelling experience. In this project, we'll use Mistral, a large language model, to generate creative stories based on any topic you provide, and then convert these stories into natural-sounding speech.

What does this guided project do?
This project demonstrates how to create an AI storyteller by:

Using Mistral to generate creative and informative stories based on your chosen topic
Converting the generated story into speech using gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)
Playing the audio directly in your Jupyter notebook
For example, you could input a topic like "the life span of trees," and Mistral will create an engaging narrative about how trees grow, survive through seasons, and can live for hundreds or even thousands of years. This story will then be converted into spoken words, making it perfect for educational content, bedtime stories, or learning about any subject in an auditory format.

Objectives
After completing this lab you will be able to:

Use Mistral to generate creative stories from any given topic
Convert the generated text to speech using the gTTS library
Create an end-to-end pipeline for AI storytelling
Play generated audio directly in Jupyter notebooks
