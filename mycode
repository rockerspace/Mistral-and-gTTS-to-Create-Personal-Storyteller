Generate a story with Mistral


# Function to generate an educational story using the Mistral model
def generate_story(topic):
    # Construct a detailed prompt that guides the model to:
    # - Write for beginners
    # - Use simple language
    # - Include interesting facts
    # - Keep a specific length
    # - End with a summary
    prompt = f"""Write an engaging and educational story about {topic} for beginners. 
            Use simple and clear language to explain basic concepts. 
            Include interesting facts and keep it friendly and encouraging. 
            The story should be around 200-300 words and end with a brief summary of what we learned. 
            Make it perfect for someone just starting to learn about this topic."""
    
    # Generate text using the model with our carefully crafted prompt
    response = model.generate_text(prompt=prompt)
    return response

# Example usage of the generate_story function
# Here we use butterflies as a topic since it's an engaging and 
# educational subject that demonstrates the function well
topic = "the life cycle of butterflies"
story = generate_story(topic)
print("Generated Story:\n", story)


Convert the story to speech
Now that we have generated our story, let's convert it to speech using the gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) library. We'll create an audio file in memory and play it directly in the notebook using an audio player widget.

This step may take a while to complete, please be patient.

NOTE: If you encounter any issues, please run the cell again.
